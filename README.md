# Baseball Salary Prediction

This project uses a Decision Tree Regressor to predict baseball player salaries. It analyzes model performance in terms of **bias-variance tradeoff** and selects an optimal tree depth based on error trends.

## Key Highlights
- Data preprocessing, log transformation
- Feature correlation and selection
- Decision Tree Regression with scikit-learn
- Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE
- Visualizations of model performance
- Hyperparameter tuning: max_depth analysis

## Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pydotplus
